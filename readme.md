# SapSap (Social Awareness Platform)

Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, PUG

Back-end API: ExpressJS

Database system: Mongoose on MongoDB Atlas

## Demo

We deployed on render.com (a free cloud hosting service that support NodeJS). Due to the limitation of render.com, after a period of time without any activity, the website would need a first request to it and it would take around 1 minute in order to wake up the service. After that, the website will work smoothly as expected:

```bash
https://acswil.onrender.com/
```

## Postman API Documentation

```bash
We will update it soon
```
