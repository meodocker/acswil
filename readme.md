# SapSap (Social Awareness Platform)

Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, PUG

Back-end API: ExpressJS

Database system: Mongoose on MongoDB Atlas

## Demo

We deployed on render.com (a free cloud hosting service that support NodeJS). Due to the limitation of render.com, if there is no activity on the webapp for a period of time, the website would need a first request to it as a service activation, and the request might take around 1 minute in order to wake up the service, that is the reason why you are experiencing delay when you first visit the website. After the re-activation, the website will work smoothly as expected:

```bash
https://acswil.onrender.com/
```

## Postman API Documentation

```bash
We will update it soon
```
